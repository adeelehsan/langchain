    "[Vectara](https://vectara.com/) is the trusted AI Assistant and Agent platform which focuses on enterprise readiness for mission-critical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectara serverless RAG-as-a-service provides all the components of RAG behind an easy-to-use API, including:\n",
    "1. A way to extract text from files (PDF, PPT, DOCX, etc)\n",
    "2. ML-based chunking that provides state of the art performance.\n",
    "3. The [Boomerang](https://vectara.com/how-boomerang-takes-retrieval-augmented-generation-to-the-next-level-via-grounded-generation/) embeddings model.\n",
    "4. Its own internal vector database where text chunks and embedding vectors are stored.\n",
    "5. A query service that automatically encodes the query into embedding, and retrieves the most relevant text segments (including support for [Hybrid Search](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/api-reference/search-apis/lexical-matching) as well as multiple reranking options such as the [multi-lingual relevance reranker](https://www.vectara.com/blog/deep-dive-into-vectara-multilingual-reranker-v1-state-of-the-art-reranker-across-100-languages), [MMR](https://vectara.com/get-diverse-results-and-comprehensive-summaries-with-vectaras-mmr-reranker/), [UDF reranker](https://www.vectara.com/blog/rag-with-user-defined-functions-based-reranking), [Chain reranker](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/chain-reranker).\n",

    "# Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, use the following steps:\n",
    "1. If you don't already have one, [Sign up](https://www.vectara.com/integrations/langchain) for your free Vectara trial. Once you have completed your sign up you will have a Vectara customer ID. You can find your customer ID by clicking on your name, on the top-right of the Vectara console window.\n",
    "2. Within your account you can create one or more corpora. Each corpus represents an area that stores text data upon ingest from input documents. To create a corpus, use the **\"Create Corpus\"** button. You then provide a name to your corpus as well as a description. Optionally you can define filtering attributes and apply some advanced options. If you click on your created corpus, you can see its name and corpus ID right on the top.\n",
    "3. Next you'll need to create API keys to access the corpus. Click on the **\"Access Control\"** tab in the corpus view and then the **\"Create API Key\"** button. Give your key a name, and choose whether you want query-only or query+index for your key. Click \"Create\" and you now have an active API key. Keep this key confidential. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use LangChain with Vectara, you'll need to have these two values: `corpus_key` and `api_key`.\n",
    "You can provide `VECTARA_CORPUS_KEY` to LangChain in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Include in your environment these two variables: `VECTARA_API_KEY`\n",
    "\n",
    "   For example, you can set these variables using os.environ and getpass as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "import getpass\n",
    "\n",
    "os.environ[\"VECTARA_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass(\"Vectara API Key:\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add them to the `Vectara` vectorstore constructor:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "vectara = Vectara(\n",
    "                vectara_api_key=vectara_api_key\n",
    "            )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `VECTARA_CORPUS_KEY` is passed to the method as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we assume they are provided in the environment."

Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson.'),\n",
